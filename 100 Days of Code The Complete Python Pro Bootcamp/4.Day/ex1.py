#Pseudo-random number generators work by performing some operations on a value. Generally, this value is the previous number generated by the generator. However, the first time you use the generator, there is no upfront value.

#Seeding the pseudo-random number generator gives it its first "previous" value. Each seed value corresponds to the set of values generated for a particular random number generator. That is, if you give the same seed twice, you will get the same number row twice.

#Generally, you want to seed your random number generator with a value that will change each run of the program. For example, the present tense is a frequently used seed. The reason this doesn't happen automatically is that if you want you can provide a specific seed to get a known sequence of numbers.
